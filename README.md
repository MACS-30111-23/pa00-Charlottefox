My name is **Xinge**, you can call me **Charlotte**. I am enrolled in the MACSS program, where I am studying computational social sciences with a strong interest in inequality, bureaucratic system and tax reform.

Outside of academics, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, movies, video games, and spending time with cats and dogs (even though I don't have pets yet, but I love them!).
